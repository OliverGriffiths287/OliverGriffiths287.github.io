            <p> 
             The following two charts demonstrate the initial skill of implementing some visualisations into the code and therefore my github portfolio page. The visualisations and code have been
              extracted from https://github.com/RDeconomist/RDeconomist.github.io/tree/main/charts/library. Vega-lite editor was helpful to ensure the code correctly
              transitioned into the visualisation.

            The next two charts build on the previous weeks skill of implementing a visualisation by producing a visualisation through the Create a chart
            function from https://www.economicsobservatory.com/explore using the api and data on UK government investment and household UkHouseholdConsumption
            Additionally, using Vega-Lite Editor, the charts have been altered visually using different font sizes, adding titles to the axes, changing the 
            dimensions of the graph as well as appearance of the line and scatters.

         <h6>Portfolio Challenge 3</h6>
            <p> Following a Festival of Economics talk about UK trade, this week's task involves creating two visualisations that relate to an argument made.
                The argument made was that investment in the UK has not matched international counterparts, such as for research, development and education.
                This first chart shows that although investment has been increasing, it is still very low per quarter in these specific sectors.

            <p> This week's challenge involved finding a visualisation used by a company, journalist, or broadcast which may not be the most clear way of presenting
                the given data and then trying to replicate it, although the specific data does not have to match. From there, I could adapt the chart to what I believe
                to be a clearer representation and change some aspects.
