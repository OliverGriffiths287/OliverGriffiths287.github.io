               Sport is no longer simply the form of entertainment we once knew it to be, it has now developed to be a
               global industry drawing attraction from all areas and individuals. As the highest viewed sport
               internationally, football is at the forefront of this evolution, displaying substantial change in the
               sport’s motive of the past, present and future. The observations and analysis of this page should help us
               to understand how individual stakeholders’ interests; for example, players, teams, leagues and fans, have
               been affected by the growing commercialisation of the sport, focussing primarily on England’s topflight
               and Europe’s most prestige competition. Commercialisation will focus on the ways that the sport is
               projected as a commodity with the purpose of increasing cash flow and investment. This will allow us to
               determine which parties have seen the drastic changes, both positive and negative, or perhaps what areas
               of the game more resources are being distributed to.

               The initial graph highlights how revenue generation has grown exponentially in the Premier League.
               Drastic increases upwards of £500 million across 1–2-year spans is typically unheard of across most
               industries. Companies House provided revenue data for both league and teams, whilst TNT housed points
               tallies. The last decade promotes the idea of the big six, with a clear positive correlation between
               financial power and success, damaging competition.

               Revenue data from UEFA highlights how surge in financial investment hasn’t flooded across Europe,
               creating significant inequality between nations. Concentration of revenue has infiltrated into the
               perceived top 5 leagues in Western Europe, creating an oligopoly effect and subsequent dominance of
               competitions.

               broadcasting contributions fuelling inflation in revenue, commercial inputs displaying £1 million
               progression, yet matchdays remaining consistent due to the difficulty of increasing stadium capacity.

               I scraped data from Capology, extracting table data and cleaning to retrieve names and salaries. The log
               scale slightly diminishes the extent of the increase, yet made for a more aesthetic visualisation, with
               median figures doubling from that decade. Finally, we can see the stratospheric salaries that players
               earn today.

            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
            <p>
               Unlike readily available macroeconomic data, most information relating to my question is not situated on
               worldwide databases, and often a single source may supply one unit of data. Similarly, the evidence was
               often located within html rather than in a data frame already.
            </p>
         </div>
      </section>

      <section>
         <div>
            <p>
               A significant struggle when retrieving data was PDF files, given most financial figures were embedded
               into reports. Persistent attempts to scrape these sources were unsuccessful, leading to timely manual
               processing and reduced automation. Similarly, the desired information didn’t align with many APIs, either
               requiring purchasing or displaying irrelevant data on regularly updated scores or statistics.
            </p>
         </div>

      <section>
         <div>
            <p>
               However, where possible I have scraped data in Colaboratory. Focussing on the page source and split
               functions from pandas, initial struggles disappeared and creating clean data frames became easier. Most
               sources display discrete values for a single season or team, therefore running the code consistently was
               unnecessary.

               Creating a responsive page also generated issues, originally producing dimensionally different charts,
               although eventually the use of container elements for height and width whilst manipulating the CSS
               allowed for successful resizing.

               Firstly, it is important to stress that commercialisation of the sport, although often a criticised
               progression, does not have only negative effects on the sport. Globalisation is a primary reason, with
               the accessibility to broadcast the game and interact with new communities greater than it has ever been
               before, whilst the popularity across regions also grows. Simultaneously, as a fan, the quality of the
               sport has never reached the levels of the present; new technologies and innovations creating new
               possibilities.

               On the other hand, the competitive nature at the pinnacle of the sport may be viewed as slightly
               diminished, as successful teams remain ahead of the competition. For the fan, there’s more to watch than
               before, yet this has come at a cost with significant subscription prices and ticket price jumps for most
               teams across the board, although this may not be visible for the lowest end tickets.

               This analysis could continue to so many applicable areas, venturing to lower leagues and the rapidly
               inclining presence of women’s football. Sport has always been a fascinating spectacle, yet the story
               behind what happens on the pitch is something I hope to explore in the future.
